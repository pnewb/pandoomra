This is an atrocity and a half.  I took the good work of MasturMynd from https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandoras_Box and then proceeded to hack together a bunch of stuff until i got a mostly funcitonal printer.

There is no manual, there is no support, there is barely CAD, and the CAD is a mess.  I was in a massive rush to try and get this functional before RMRRF and the haste shows.

Pandoomra.step is the primary working point, but really has the skirt and the panels and a mount for the BTT raspberry pad, which MM was kind enough to mock up for me, but could probably do with some TLC also.

Pandoomra front Z belt carrier.step is a narrowed down version of Zruncho's printed slicers from https://github.com/zruncho3d/BoxZero (as seen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXZt2rP1yQQ)  .  The door on pandoomra does not allow for offsets required to use standard MGN9 carriages, and this seemed a reasonable solution.

Pandoorma narrow front z carriage.step is a narrowed version of the Z belt mounts which are needed for matching the printed carriages.  Fusion was too slow with the whole model, so this got broken out and then never reintegrated.


There's a list of fixes a half a mile long, but just camping on this and not letting anyone else play with it helps nobody.
